## IMPORTANT

* This pod will no longer function until support is built out for Savvy Wallet, Paybear v2

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Usage

#### Set Paybear API key
```swift
Paybear.shared.setToken("your-api-key")
```

#### Get current market prices
```swift
Paybear.shared.getCurrencies(completion: { (currencies, error) in
    if let currencies = currencies, error == nil {
        // Array of currency. Nice
    }
})
```

#### Get market exchange rates for all cryptocurrencies
```swift
Paybear.shared.getMarketRates(fiat: .usd) { (rates, error) in
    if let rates = rates, error == nil {
        // ...
    }
}
```

#### Get single market exchange rate for cryptocurrency
```swift
Paybear.shared.getSingleMarketRate(fiat: .usd, crypto: .btc) { (rate, error) in
    if let rate = rate, error == nil {
        // ...
    }
}
```

#### Create payment request in given cryptocurrency
```swift
Paybear.shared.createPaymentRequest(crypto: .btc, callbackURL: "http://ryans.online") { (request, error) in
    if let request = request, error == nil {
        // ...
    }
}
```

#### Create payment request as QR code image
```swift
Paybear.shared.getPaymentRequestQR(crypto: .btc, amount: 1.0, address: "123", message: "Free money", size: nil) { (image) in
    if let image = image {
        // QR code image containing a payment URL
    }
}
```

#### Login a user
```swift
Paybear.shared.login(email: "you@paybear.io", password: "password", twoFactorDelegate: nil) { (token, error) in
    if let token = token, error == nil {
        // We can now make user-based requests with our stored token!
    }
}
```

#### Another way to login a user
Utilize the `TwoFactorAuthProtocol` to receive a callback when a 2FA code is requested.

```swift
Paybear.shared.login(email: "you@paybear.io", password: "password", twoFactorDelegate: self) { (token, error) in
    if let token = token, error == nil {
        // We can now make user-based requests with our stored token!
    }
}
```

```swift
func paybearDidRequestTwoFactorAuthentication() {
    // Prompt for 2FA code here
    
    Paybear.shared.loginTwoFactor(code: "123456") { (success) in
        if success {
            // We have completed the login process
        }
    }
}
```

#### Post-login two-factor authentication
```swift
Paybear.shared.loginTwoFactor(code: "123456") { (success) in
    if success {
        // We have completed the login process
        // Best to call this function on login completion
    }
}
```

#### Get user properties
```swift
Paybear.shared.getUser(completion: { (user, error) in
    if let user = user, error == nil {
        // We've got a valid user object!
    }
})
```

#### Enable or disable a currency on the dashboard
```swift
Paybear.shared.enableCurrency(.btc, enable: true, address: "123", completion: { (success) in
    if success {
        // Enabled BTC with wallet address 123
    }
})
```
